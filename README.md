# Spring Beans Project

This project demonstrates the use of Spring Framework for managing beans using XML configuration and component scanning. The project includes multiple Java classes (`Student`, `Teacher`, `Course`) that are managed as Spring beans, and it showcases how to configure and retrieve beans using the `ApplicationContext` in a Spring-based application.

## Features

- **Spring XML Configuration**: The project uses XML-based configuration to define the context and enable component scanning.
- **Component Scanning**: Beans are automatically registered by Spring through component scanning using the `@Component` annotation.
- **Multiple Beans**: Includes `Student`, `Teacher`, and `Course` classes, each managed as a Spring bean.
- **Dependency Injection**: Spring handles the injection of dependencies between different beans.
